# Coding In Public: Day 2 -Create Mirror NFT Failed

Today, I collected my Web3 lesson’s learning summary and wrote several UML diagrams to help 
myself learn the technology quickly. I also wrote some Web3 knowledge points in Anki.

In the afternoon, I tried to use Mirror’s NFT feature. I attempted many times to create an 
NFT, but all actions failed. I noticed that creating an NFT on Mirror doesn’t cost the creator’s 
gas fee, but in my charge panel, the gas fee showed as $0.01. I don’t understand why this 
happened, and I’m still trying to find the answer.

After that, I continued with my IELTS lessons. I realized that three years ago, when I was 
reading tweets, I could understand the content but couldn’t feel the emotions behind the 
words. Even though I understood what they were talking about, I couldn’t grasp the emotions 
in the native speaker’s words. Maybe it’s due to the difference between written words and 
spoken language.
