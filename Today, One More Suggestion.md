# Today, One More Suggestion

I think Mirror's user experience needs to be upgraded. Regardless of the issue's cause, the Mirror 
platform must address the following three problems:

Today, I wrote a blog recording my indie coding daily life. When I clicked the "Publish" button to 
publish my blog, Mirror popped up a window asking me to try switching the network. Mirror's default 
network is OP, and I'm sure my wallet configuration is correct, but the check window kept loading, 
which was frustrating. When I changed Mirror's network setting to Polygon, the blog was published 
immediately. I suggest the Mirror team add a network health monitor, so that your loyal fans don't 
have to do this work themselves. They enjoy writing on your platform, and thatâ€™s an honor for you.

After publishing the blog, I tried to create an NFT and encountered the same network issue. I 
switched to all the networks supported by Mirror, but all of them failed. At one point, I saw 
Mirror's page invoke the MetaMask charging window, but I couldn't click the confirm button because 
it was greyed out. I was getting frustrated with these two problems.

Mirror.xyz's performance feels like it was developed by an amateur team. I see its topics are always 
hot, but the user experience is indeed terrible.

I hope Mirror.xyz can improve these issues.
