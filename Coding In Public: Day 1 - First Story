# Coding In Public: Day 1 - First Story

Today is the first time I am using the "coding in public" method. I see many developers in
Web3 share their coding progress, new projects, or even small life ideas—they put everything 
online. At first, I didn’t care much about this coding method, until I read the book The 
Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness. The book mentions a work-life 
balance concept. This idea gave me a lot of inspiration, so I decided to start writing my 
coding story on Medium. Although English is not my native language, I will try my best to 
tell the story of coding in public as well as I can.
